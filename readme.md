## Resume :


This master’s thesis focuses on the development of the GReQL Converter to simplify the process of 
generating feedback rules for UML models in the context of E-Assessment systems. The tool
is designed to provide (semi-)automated support to teachers in creating GReQL code required for
evaluating student submissions related to UML class diagram tasks on the JACK platform. 
The GReQL Converter is designed to address the challenges that teachers face when creating
GReQL code, such as the need for expertise in GReQL syntax and the time-consuming nature of 
the process. The tool aims to streamline the process of generating feedback rules for UML
models, thereby improving the efficiency and effectiveness of E-Assessment systems. 
The results of this work demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the GReQL
Converter in simplifying the process of generating feedback rules for UML models.
